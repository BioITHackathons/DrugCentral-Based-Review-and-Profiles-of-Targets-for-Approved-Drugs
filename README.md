DrugCentral Based Review and Profiles of Targets for Approved-Drugs

Goal - We aim to build on prior research that identified potential colorectal cancer drugs by linking genetic data to drug pathways and scoring their effectiveness. Our next steps are:
Expand to Other Cancers – Apply this method to cancers with similar classification systems, such as bladder, ovarian, and small-cell lung cancer.
Enhance Diagnostics – Use Drug Central to map available treatments to genetic cancer data, creating an evidence score to assess the effectiveness of drug combinations in clinical settings.
This will help improve precision medicine by making cancer treatment more personalized and data-driven
